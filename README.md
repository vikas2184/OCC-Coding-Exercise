1. Download and unzip attached file.
2. import as maven project to workspace.
3. run maven "clean install" to make sure dependency came through.
4. I have kept two below files in src/main/resources/ so need to add same to arguments while running java application.
    "src/main/resources/OCC Take Home Coding names.txt"   
    "src/main/resources/OCC Take Home Coding names short.txt"
5. Junit can be run independently but even it will be automatically run while maven install.
